# Projects Overview

This folder contains a collection of key projects I have worked on throughout my academic and professional journey. Each project showcases my skills in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing. Below is a brief description of some notable projects included in this folder:

## Crisp-Data-Wrangling

### Description: 
This project is designed to help you clean up and transform CSV data based on specified configuration rules. It reads an input CSV file, applies the transformations defined in a `config.json` file, and produces a new CSV file as the output. Any issues encountered (like invalid dates) are logged in `transform_errors.log`, allowing for easy troubleshooting.

### Technologies Used: 
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas:** Used for efficient data manipulation.
- **JSON:** The transformation rules are stored in `config.json` for easy modification.

### Key Contributions:
- Developed a robust data transformation tool that successfully cleans and formats CSV data based on user-defined rules.
- Achieved an efficient processing pipeline that can handle standard CSV data inputs, producing transformed output while logging errors for further review.
- Implemented error handling mechanisms to log issues encountered during transformation, facilitating easier debugging.
- Planned future enhancements, including support for larger datasets through chunked processing and improved error handling strategies.
